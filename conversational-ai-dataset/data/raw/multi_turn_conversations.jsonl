Here's why:\n\n**Why Roth IRA makes sense for you:**\n\n**Tax situation:**\n- **Your tax bracket** - Likely 22% federal, relatively moderate\n- **Future earnings** - You'll probably earn more later in your career\n- **Tax-free growth** - 37+ years until retirement, that's huge compound growth\n\n**Flexibility benefits:**\n- **Withdraw contributions** - Penalty-free anytime (not earnings though)\n- **No required distributions** - Unlike traditional IRAs at age 73\n- **Tax diversification** - Good to have some tax-free money in retirement\n\n**Your action plan:**\n\n**Immediate steps:**\n1. **Keep $2,500 in savings** - Your emergency fund\n2. **Invest $2,500 in Roth IRA** - Get started this year\n3. **Set up automatic $500/month** - Maxes out your $6,500 annual limit\n\n**Simple investment strategy:**\n- **Target-date fund 2065** - Automatically adjusts as you age\n- **Or DIY approach** - 80% total stock market index, 20% bonds\n- **Start with one fund** - You can always adjust later\n\n**The math on your timeline:**\n- **$6,500/year for 37 years** at 7% average return\n- **Total contributions** - $240,500\n- **Estimated value** - Over $1.3 million (tax-free!)\n\n**Where to open:**\n- **Fidelity** - Excellent target-date funds, $0 minimums\n- **Vanguard** - Low-cost pioneer, great index funds\n- **Schwab** - Good all-around option\n\n**Pro tip:** Open the account and make your first investment this week.
