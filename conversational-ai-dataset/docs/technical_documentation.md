# Conversational AI Training Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains high-quality conversational examples designed for training transformer-based AI models (GPT-style). The conversations demonstrate natural, helpful, and engaging interactions between users and an AI assistant across diverse topics and conversation styles.

## Dataset Structure

### File Format
- **Format**: JSONL (JSON Lines)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Structure**: Each line contains a complete conversation in JSON format

### Conversation Format
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "User message text"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant response text"}
  ]
}
```

## Dataset Files

### 1. `conversational_dataset.jsonl`

## Usage Guidelines

### Training Recommendations
- **Batch size**: Start with smaller batches (4-8) for fine-tuning
- **Learning rate**: Conservative rates (1e-5 to 5e-5) recommended
- **Validation split**: Reserve 10-15% for validation
- **Evaluation metrics**: Consider BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation

### Data Preprocessing
- Conversations are already cleaned and formatted
- No additional preprocessing required
- Consider tokenization limits for your specific model
- May want to filter by conversation length based on model capacity

### Augmentation Suggestions
- Add conversations in different languages
- Include domain-specific conversations for specialized use cases
- Create conversations with different personality styles
- Add conversations with various levels of formality
